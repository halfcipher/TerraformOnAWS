AWS EKS solution with Terraform.

In this solution I have used Terraform EKS Module from official Terraform Registry (Link(https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/latest)).

As metioned in the problem statement, i havent launched this config just stimulated the plan with the help of "Terraform Plan" cmd in order to achieve the second condition which was no charges should occur.

This repository contains 5 files including Read.me as follow.
    - main.tf       = main program
    - variables.tf  = file with variables details
    - provider.tf   = file with provider details 
    - plan.txt      = this file contains output of "plan" command


Steps:

1. Launched AWS
2. Started AWS CLI 
3. Installed Terraform
4. Configured Terraform
5. Created respective files
6. Downloaded Module from Terraform Registry
7. Stimulated solution on Terraform

Thanks!
